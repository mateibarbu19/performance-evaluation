# Performance Evaluation

This repo provides solutions for some assignments for the Performance
Evaluation course taught at POLITEHNICA University of Bucharest.

It started as a proof of concept that a comprehensive proof of work can be
written. The tools used were Markdown ([Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) flavor),
with [`asciinema`](https://asciinema.org).

Next, I wanted to prove that high-quality articles and presentations could also
be realized, providing beautiful solutions.

This repo juxtaposes the recommended approach of submitting screenshots
in [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) word processors like
Microsoft Word.
